- Basic animations to enhance user experience

## Requirements

- Flutter 3.22.2

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the app**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/flutter-messaging-app.git
   cd flutter-messaging-app
   ```

2. **Get dependencies**:
   ```bash
   dart pub get
   ```

3. **Create a Firebase project**:
   - Go to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
   - Click on "Add project" and follow the steps to create a new project.

4. **Register your Android app with Firebase**:
   - In the Firebase Console, select your project.
   - Click on the Android icon to add an Android app.
   - Enter your application ID (found in `android/app/build.gradle`).
   - Follow the instructions to download the `google-services.json` file.

5. **Add the `google-services.json` file**:
   - Place the `google-services.json` file in `android/app`.

6. **Sync your Firebase app with your Flutter app**:
   - Ensure your Flutter app is synced with the Firebase project by following the steps in the Firebase Console.

7. **Enable Firebase Authentication with email and password**:
   - In the Firebase Console, navigate to Authentication.
   - Enable the Email/Password sign-in method.

8. **Enable Cloud Firestore**:
   - In the Firebase Console, navigate to Firestore Database.
   - Create a new Firestore database in test mode (for development purposes).
   - Create a collection named "messages".

## Firebase Rules for Development Mode

Make sure your Firebase rules are in development mode (not recommended for production):

```json
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /{document=**} {
      allow read, write: if true;
    }
  }
}

service firebase.storage {
  match /b/{bucket}/o {
    match /{allPaths=**} {
      allow read, write: if true;
    }
  }
}
```

## Running the App

Once you have completed the setup, you can run the app using the following command:

```bash
flutter run
```
